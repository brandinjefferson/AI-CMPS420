Write a description of a world and movements, then translate it into prolog.

The world is a 9x9 square grid. A wumpus is located at the square (3,4). Pits are
located at squares (5,6), (2,2), and (7,8). Gold is located at squares (3,3), (9,8). 

The agent climbs down into grid (1,1) facing 0 degrees (east) with 2 arrows at his disposal.
-
The agent turns left or right (+/- 90 degrees) or moves forward or shoots an arrow in the
direction he's facing.
If the agent reaches a block with a stench or breeze, then he is aware of that thing being nearby.
 He will shoot in one direction. If the wumpus is on that row/column, it will scream and die.
 Otherwise it will thunk against the wall.
If the agent reaches a room with a pit or the wumpus.
 He dies. End simulation.
If the agent finds a room that glitters:
 He picks up the gold. 
 If there are more gold, repeat at line 7.
 Else, he needs to go back to cell (1,1).
  Climb out and he's done.
